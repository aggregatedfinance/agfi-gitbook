# Liquidity Locker

The AGFI liquidity locker is a decentralized finance (DeFi) tool that allows users to securely lock their digital assets in a smart contract. This smart contract acts as a "locker" for these assets, allowing them to be held securely until the user decides to unlock them.

The AGFI liquidity locker is based on the Unicrypt liquidity token locker, which has been audited for security and reliability. This means that users can trust that their assets will be held safely and securely within the smart contract.

One of the key features of the AGFI liquidity locker is its support for Signata KYC enforcement. Signata is a decentralized identity verification platform that allows users to prove their identity using NFTs that represent proof of KYC. By integrating with Signata, the AGFI liquidity locker is able to ensure that only verified users are able to access their locked assets.

Overall, the AGFI liquidity locker is a reliable and secure DeFi tool that allows users to lock their digital assets in a smart contract, ensuring that they are held safely and securely until they are ready to be unlocked. With its integration with Signata, users can also have confidence in the security of their assets, knowing that only verified users have access to them.

AGFI's liquidity locker charges fees for each lock. The fees are as follows:

| Network  | DEX        | Fee     |
| -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Ethereum | Uniswap V2 | 0.1 ETH |
|          |            |         |
|          |            |         |
