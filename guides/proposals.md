## Creating Proposals on GitHub

Creating proposals for the Aggregated Finance DAO is a very simple process. It all starts with GitHub, where all the proposal discussion needs to happen:

If you want to be involved in the discussions on GitHub then you will need to create a GitHub account. It's a very easy process, just follow the prompts:

The AGFI DAO is a "repository" on GitHub. Normally repositories are used to store code, but in our case we'll just use it for discussion and information about the Proposals for the DAO.

> Did you know Ethereum uses GitHub for all of its proposals too? You can check out the Ethereum proposals here: [https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs)

Every Proposal is handled as an **Issue** in the DAO repository.

You will see all the open proposals here when you view the Issues section. If you want to start a discussion about a new proposal, click **New Issue** on the top-right of the page:

There are some templates you can use to make a new proposal. After the DAO gets set up most of these will be "Treasury Allocation" proposals. If none of these proposals meet your needs you can also choose _Open a blank issue_ **** at the bottom.

Now all you need to do is fill out the details. Give it a title that makes sense, and fill in the details about what the proposal will do and why it should be voted on. Once you've filled in all the information, click **Submit new issue**:

The proposal will be open for anyone to review, comment, and discuss if it should move to a formal vote.

> The Proposal Managers may edit or reject your proposal if it doesn't satisfy all the information needed to move it to a formal vote. Every vote needs a justification as to why it should happen, otherwise why do it at all?

If you want to voice your opinion, you can write your own response to any proposal at the bottom by adding a comment:
